# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am proud of myself when I got stuck on the bonus part of exercise 4 in final_practice and reached out to another student to see how they attacked the problem. Working with oters to slove problems is one of my favorite parts about this journey through Turing. This feels like we are getting into the part of coding I am very excited for!

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods will help developers solve many problems. Basically by using the "instructions" we give the line of code, this will help us solve the problem. Being able to call on methods as many times as needed is very powerful also. And finally, if there is a problem that is unique we can even creat a method to help solve. Very powerful.
